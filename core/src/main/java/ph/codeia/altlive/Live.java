/**
 * An object that emits values to observers associated with a lifecycle.
 *
 * <p> This interface is patterned after the public interface of AAC's
 * {@code MutableLiveData} class with a few differences:
 *
 * <ul><li> The input and output sides are split. This interface represents
 * the output side and {@link Feed} represents the input side.
 * <li> {@code getValue()} is excluded from the interface because code relying
 * on that is likely to be using observables incorrectly. It still exists in
 * {@link LiveField} though and is public as well.
 * <li> The methods for querying the presence of observers are gone. I think
 * they have no value outside of tests, and tests relying on them in order to
 * verify expected behavior are badly written.
 * <li> Added default methods for listening to a single update. The observer is
 * removed automatically after being invoked once.</ul>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the observable data
